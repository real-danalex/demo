                <h3>1. Sourcing Quality Ingredients</h3>
                <p>We start by selecting the finest locally sourced grains, flours, and natural ingredients. 
                   No preservatives or artificial enhancers — just pure, wholesome goodness.</p>
            </div>

                <p>Each dough batch is precisely mixed to achieve the perfect texture.

                <p>Our breads are baked daily in stone-deck ovens, creating the perfect golden crust and soft interior. 
                   Each loaf is baked to perfection — never rushed, always fresh.</p>

                <h3>5. Fresh Daily Delivery</h3>
                <p>Once cooled, our breads are carefully packaged and delivered fresh every morning to homes, 
                   stores, and cafes — so you always enjoy bread baked the same day.</p>
